# Advanced-Kinematics


In this project, the kinematics of a 2-link planar robot was analyzed, the forward and inverse kinematics equations were solved analytically, and the Jacobian matrix was derived to study singularity points.

A numerical inverse kinematics (numerical IK) algorithm was developed using MATLAB/Octave, and pseudoinverse Jacobian was applied to optimize the robot's movement.

Different initial positions and target points were tested to examine the effects of the optimization loop and various parameters.
